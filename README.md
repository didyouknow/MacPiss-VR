# MacPiss-VR
MacPiss VR is a VR Link Application to allow PSVR to run with Steam VR on Mac.  Method: MacPiss will run as a full screen application to be used on the PSVR which is recognized as an external display. OpenVR (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/API-Documentation) will be used to link the MacPiss to Steam VR, MacPiss will relay the output information to the PSVR which is connected through HDMI. There will be a second MacPiss window that runs on the main system to help monitor the “External Display” and keep it clean from other desktop junk.  Plan: 1. See how much of this is realistic. Mess around with the PSVR. 2. Write a test that displays on an external display, and then test on PSVR. 3. Implement OpenVR so Steam VR recognizes it. 4. Create second window so MacPiss can be killed or controlled from the Primary Display. 5. Find a way to implement motion tracking. 6. Clean up code.
